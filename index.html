                    <p>Let's go, I sure hope we find Jennifer before she finds herself! (He looks at a sign which gives information on the skyway. It says "Skewed on Skyway C25".) Damn, the skyway's jammed, it's going to take us forever to get there. (Almanac) And this stays here, I didn't invent the time machine to win at gambling, I invented the time machine to travel through time! I know, I know Doc! </p>
                    <p>(Doc puts the almanac on a barrel and the two leave. Unknown to them, Biff has been overhearing! He opens a door to see the almanac and picks it up.) So, Doc Brown invented a time machine. (Hilldale) (The police car arrives. The signs outside say "Hilldale - The Address Of Success" but have been altered to say "The Address Of Suckers". The car lands outside a house and the officers open the door.)</p>

                    <p>Right. Once Old Biff has gone, grab the almanac any way you can. Remember both of our futures depend on this! You don't have to remind me of that</p>

                    <p>Doc! Here's some binoculars and a walkie-talkie so we can keep in contact. I'll stay here and try to repair the shortened time circuits. That way we don't risk anyone else stealing the time machine, and I won't risk accidentally running into my other self. Your other self?</p>

                        We're back. (Doc flies the DeLorean down a street, lets the wheels down and lands, driving normally to a house - Jennifer's. It parks in her driveway. He and Marty get out, carrying Jennifer. Neither of them notice the wrecked car in the driveway. They put her on her porch swing.) Let's put her in the swing! Then I'll take you home and you can come back in your truck and wake her. When she awakens here in her own house and it's dark, you should be able to convince her it was all a dream. Wait a minute, we're just going to leave her here on the porch? The disorientation will help convince her that it was all a dream.
